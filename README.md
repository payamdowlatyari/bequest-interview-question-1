# Tamper Proof Data

At Bequest, we require that important user data is tamper proof. Otherwise, our system can incorrectly distribute assets if our internal database is breached. 
Only the user is able to update their own data.


**1. How does the client insure that their data has not been tampered with? Assume that the database is compromised.**

There are different methods for temper-proofing data but none of them is as successful as the blockchain technology.
Blockchain uses peer-to-peer transactions with a decentralized structure that makes tampering impossible. 

<br />
**2. If the data has been tampered with, how can the client recover the lost data?**

There are different methods for recovering lost data and one of the advantages of the blockchain technology is 
disaster recovery.   

Edit this repo to answer these two questions using any technologies you'd like, there any many possible solutions. Feel free to add comments.
